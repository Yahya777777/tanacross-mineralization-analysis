# Mineralization Analysis in the Tanacross Area (Alaska)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores **Au (gold) and Cu (copper) mineralization patterns** in the Tanacross area of Alaska using sediment geochemical data.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ScienceBase Catalog**:  
ðŸ”— [Sediment Geochemical Data â€“ Tanacross Area, Alaska](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d8e655de4b0c4f70d0ccdf5)

The analysis in this notebook is based on the file:  
**`USGS_Tanacross_Sediment_Sample_Results_2017_2018.csv`**  

Please download this file directly from the ScienceBase page above.
